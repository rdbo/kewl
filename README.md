# Kewl Projects
This is my personal list of projects I would like to do.

## Proxychains that uses syscalls (proxybind)
I already started making that one but didn't finish: [rdbo/proxybind](https://github.com/rdbo/proxybind)

## Search Engine for the Web that is fully open source, very performant and gives good results
The top search engines as of now are all closed source, so I feel like there should be one open source engine to rule them all

## End-to-End Encrypted Chat App with bleeding edge cryptography
Make a chat app (with groups support) that has the best modern cryptography available for E2EE.

Currenly, good options would be using an RSA + ECDHE + AES-GCM algorithm. The best option is likely and implementation of Signal's Double Ratchet algorithm.

It could be like IRC, but with encryption by default and lightweight servers.

## Wayland Compositor that is like river/hyprland, written in Rust for memory safety
I like how river works, and I also like Hyprland animations. Maybe you could mix them using a memory-safe language (Rust)?

## Widgets App
Something like eww (Elkowar's Wacky Widgets), but with significantly easier configuration

## Sigma Linux (Wayland edition)
Done. Yay!

URL: https://github.com/rdbo/sigma-linux

~Create a new version of Sigma Linux using a Wayland compositor (perhaps the one we create above?)~

## Libmem Update
Make a new version of libmem with Lua bindings, bug fixes, easier installation, etc.

## Learn Crypto/Blockchain
Do something related to crypto/blockchain, i don't know what. Maybe a payment system that creates wallets and sends the payment directly to your main wallet.

## Make COBOL text editor

Make a really basic text editor with COBOL
